# Graphs

## Terminology

-   cycle: when you start at node(x), follow the links and end back at node(x)
-   acyclic - a graph that contains no cycles
-   connected - when every node has a path to another one
-   directed - when there is a direction to the connections. think twitter.
-   undirected - think facebook
-   weighted - the edges have a weight associated with them. think maps.
-   dag - directed, acyclic graph

Implementation Terms

-   vertex: a point or node on the graph
-   edge: the connection between two nodes

Big O is commonly stated in terms of vertex and edges. O(V \* E)
